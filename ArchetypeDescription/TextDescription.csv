1900,1964,Single Family House,Detached House ,Netherlands,"The wall construction of detached houses in the Netherlands has evolved significantly throughout the 20th and early 21st century, mainly driven by changes in construction technology, material availability, and increasingly strict energy regulations. Detached houses built between 1900 and the mid-1960s were predominantly constructed with monolithic masonry walls, most commonly solid brickwork. This construction method reflects the strong brick-building tradition in the Netherlands. External walls typically ranged from 20 to 35 cm in thickness and provided structural stability but limited thermal performance by modern standards. During the 1960s, many of these houses underwent renovations due to emerging energy regulations. Heating systems were often upgraded, and in some cases internal insulation was added. Occasionally, a second external wall layer was constructed to improve insulation and renew the façade. However, many of these buildings are protected under heritage legislation, which has preserved the original solid brick masonry and limited alterations to the exterior","Detached houses built up to and including 1964 represent 418,000 homes, representing 5.6% of the Dutch housing stock. Approximately 88% of these are owned by the resident, and approximately 12% are rented. Homes in this category often have 4 to 6 rooms spread over 2 to 4 floors. These homes often have a wooden ground floor. Original Energy Level: In the period up to and including 1964, no energy efficiency requirements were imposed on homes. Therefore, homes were not insulated. Cavity walls were not used until around 1930. Houses built before 1960 often had steel and softwood frames with single glazing. Many homes were equipped with local gas heaters, electric boilers, and natural ventilation during that period. Central heating was used on a limited scale. Current energy level: A large proportion of these homes have been retrofitted with insulation over the years. Almost all homes now have central heating with individual heat generation. The HR107 boiler is the most common (95%). A relatively small number of homes have a different generator (HR100 1%, electric heat pump 2%). For hot water, a gas-fired combination boiler is by far the most commonly used (94%), with some electric boilers (2%) and heat pumps (2%). Retrofitted insulation focuses on installing double glazing (49% of the glass surface) and HR++ glass (29%). 13% of the glass surface in these homes is still single-glazed. Retrofitted insulation of the solid sections is lacking. 58% of the solid facade sections are insulated, 47% of the floor area, 70% of the pitched roof, and 57% of the flat roof. The majority of homes have natural ventilation (90%). The remaining units have mechanical ventilation. Some of the homes are fitted with airtight seals."
1965,1974,Single Family House,Detached House ,Netherlands,"The wall construction of detached houses in the Netherlands has evolved significantly throughout the 20th and early 21st century, mainly driven by changes in construction technology, material availability, and increasingly strict energy regulations. In the post-war period, construction techniques shifted toward cavity wall systems. During this era, external walls typically consisted of an inner load-bearing layer made of lightweight concrete or lightweight brick, an uninsulated cavity of approximately 8 cm, and an outer façade layer of about 5 cm thick brickwork. The outer layer was often made of brick, sand-lime brick, or lightweight brick, with occasional use of wooden panels. This construction period followed the Model Bouwverordening (MBV) 1965, which standardized building practices but still placed limited emphasis on thermal insulation. ","Detached houses built between 1965 and 1974 represent 128,500, representing 1.7% of the Dutch housing stock. Homes from this period are all owned by the resident. The homes in this category often have 4 to 6 rooms, spread over 2 to 4 floors. These houses are often traditionally built with load-bearing walls of sand-lime brick and concrete floors. Original Energy Level: Since 1965, requirements have been imposed on the energy quality of homes. However, by current new construction standards, these homes were not very well insulated. Natural ventilation was used to ventilate these homes. Central heating has been increasingly used in this type of home over the years. Current energy level: Some of these homes have been energy-efficiently upgraded over the years. All homes from this period have central heating with individual heat generation. The HR107 boiler is the most common (89%). A smaller proportion of homes have a CR boiler (6%) or an electric heat pump (3%). In addition to gas-fired combination boilers (85%), electric boilers (4%), various types of kitchen heaters or water heaters (9% in total), and heat pumps (2%) are also used for hot water production. Regarding retrofitting, the focus is on installing double glazing (58% of the glass surface) and HR++ glass (24%). Retrofitting of solid sections lags behind slightly. 73% of the solid facade sections are insulated, 35% of the floor area, 76% of the pitched roof, and 57% of the flat roof. The majority of homes have natural ventilation (84%). The remaining portion has mechanical extraction (14%) or balanced ventilation (3%). Some of the homes are equipped with airtight sealing."
1975,1991,Single Family House,Detached House ,Netherlands,"The wall construction of detached houses in the Netherlands has evolved significantly throughout the 20th and early 21st century, mainly driven by changes in construction technology, material availability, and increasingly strict energy regulations. From the mid-1970s onward, energy efficiency became a more prominent concern. Cavity walls and multilayer wall systems remained the dominant construction method, but insulation was increasingly added within the cavity. Inner walls were typically constructed from precast concrete or brick masonry, while the outer façade remained a thin brick layer of approximately 5 cm. The cavity was usually filled with EPS (expanded polystyrene) or glass wool insulation, commonly between 5 and 8 cm thick. Façade materials included sand-lime brick, lightweight brick, and occasionally wooden cladding.","Detached houses built between 1975 and 1991 represent 201,000 homes, representing 2.7% of the Dutch housing stock. The majority, 95%, are owned by the residents, and approximately 5% are rented. Homes in this category often have 4 to 7 rooms spread over 2 to 4 floors. More than half of the homes have three floors. These homes are often traditionally built, but the diversity of these homes is increasing. Original energy level: The energy quality requirements for new-build homes were increased in 1975 (Rc 1.3 m²K/W for roof and solid facade), in 1979 (double glazing in living areas), in 1983 (Rc 1.3 m²K/W ground floor), and in 1988 (Rc 2.0 m²K/W for roof and solid facade). Houses from the first part of this period, in particular, were not very well insulated by current new-build standards. The homes were primarily naturally ventilated. Central heating has become increasingly common over the years. Current energy level: All homes have central heating with individual heat generation. The high-efficiency boiler is the most common (HR107 86% and HR100 6%). A small percentage of homes are heated locally with electricity (3%) or have a heat pump (2%). In addition to combination boilers (91%), electric boilers (4%) and gas water heaters (5%) are also used for hot water production. Double glazing is prevalent (66% of the glass surface). Some of the glass surface of these homes has been upgraded to HR++ glass (20% of the glass surface). Single glazing is still present to a limited extent (4%). Detached homes built after this period no longer have single glazing. All solid facades are insulated, although the insulation level is generally not very high. A large portion of the floors (80%) and roofs (89% sloped, 55% flat) are insulated. Most of the homes have natural ventilation (78%). The remainder have mechanical ventilation (21%). The homes are equipped with airtight seals."
1992,2005,Single Family House,Detached House ,Netherlands,"The wall construction of detached houses in the Netherlands has evolved significantly throughout the 20th and early 21st century, mainly driven by changes in construction technology, material availability, and increasingly strict energy regulations. This period followed the introduction of the Bouwbesluit 1992, which significantly raised insulation requirements for walls and other building elements. Detached houses were mainly constructed using multilayer or cavity wall systems with improved thermal performance.
Typical wall assemblies consisted of a thicker load-bearing inner brick layer (approximately 15–22 cm), followed by an insulation layer of 5–8 cm made of EPS or glass wool. The exterior façade layer could be composed of brick, sand-lime brick, brick panels, or wooden cladding. Overall wall thickness and thermal resistance increased compared to earlier periods.","Detached houses built between 1992 and 2005 represent 196,000 homes, representing approximately 2.6% of the Dutch housing stock. Homes from this period are all owned by the resident. Homes in this category often have 4 to 7 rooms, spread over 2 to 4 floors. The period 1992 to 2005 was characterized by the rise of timber-frame construction and catalog construction for detached houses. However, most were built traditionally with load-bearing walls of sand-lime brick and concrete floors. Original energy level: Houses from this period are well insulated. In 1992, insulation requirements were raised, requiring double glazing and insulation of the facade, floor, and roof (Rc 2.5 m²K/W). High-efficiency boilers were widely used for heating homes. Mechanical ventilation with an extractor fan also gained attention. Current energy level: All homes have central heating with individual heat generation. The high-efficiency boiler is the most common (HR107 89%, HR100 6%, and HR104 2%). In addition to combination boilers (94%), electric boilers (3%) and gas water heaters (2%) are used very rarely for hot water production. Heat pumps account for 1%. None of the detached homes in this period still have single glazing. The glazing is divided between double glazing (39% of the glass surface), high-efficiency glass (16%), high-efficiency glass (10%), and high-efficiency glass (34%). All solid facades, floors, and roofs are insulated, with the insulation level meeting at least the requirements of the construction period (Rc 2.5 m²K/W). The majority of homes are equipped with mechanical ventilation (65%) or natural ventilation (24%). Balanced ventilation is becoming increasingly popular (11%).

Construction practices during this period largely continued the trends established between 1992 and 2005, in line with later revisions of the Bouwbesluit (notably the 2012 revision). Wall systems remained primarily cavity or multilayer constructions, with similar material compositions but improved detailing, airtightness, and thermal performance.","Detached houses built between 2006 and 2014 represent 66,000 homes, representing approximately 0.9% of the Dutch housing stock.

Detached houses from 2006 to 2014 were also mostly built traditionally (load-bearing walls with sand-lime brick and concrete floors) and, on a modest scale, using timber framing. Original energy level: The houses from this period are well insulated. Between 2006 and 2014, the EPC requirement was tightened from 1.0 to 0.6. This means that houses in this period the insulation needs to be improved during this period. High-efficiency boilers were widely used for heating homes. Balanced ventilation was also a priority. Current energy level: All homes have central heating with individual heat generation (97%), and a small proportion rely on third-party heat supply (3%). The HR107 boiler is the most common (89%). Some homes have a heat pump (8%) or are connected to district heating (third-party heat supply 3%) for both space heating and hot water. Almost all homes have HR++ glass (94%). All solid facades, floors, and roofs are insulated, with the insulation level meeting at least the requirements from the construction period (Rc 2.5 m²K/W).

2015,2018,Single Family House,Detached House ,Netherlands,"The wall construction of detached houses in the Netherlands has evolved significantly throughout the 20th and early 21st century, mainly driven by changes in construction technology, material availability, and increasingly strict energy regulations. In this most recent period, wall construction types did not change fundamentally. Detached houses continued to use cavity wall or multilayer systems. The main differences lie in the use of higher-performance insulation materials and better thermal conductivity values, driven by stricter energy efficiency standards and sustainability goals. Improved construction quality, reduced thermal bridging, and increased attention to airtightness characterise this era.","The detached houses built between 2015 and 2018 represent 31,000 homes, approximately 0.4% of the Dutch housing stock. Homes from this period are all owned by the resident. The homes in this category often have 4 to 7 rooms spread over 2 to 5 floors. Over 46% of the homes have three floors, and 31% have five floors. The quality and luxury of the homes increased significantly during this period. Heating costs for these homes are low. In addition, the homes are built with low-maintenance building materials. The architecture and construction methods vary widely, from 1930s styles (brick and overhanging pitched roofs) to ultra-modern (extensive glass, metal, and flat roofs). Original energy level As of April 1, 2012, the Building Decree increased the minimum Rc value (thermal resistance) of floors, facades, and roofs of new buildings from 2.5 to 3.5 m2.K/W. Subsequently, on March 1, 2013, the maximum U-value of windows was tightened from 2.2 to 1.65 W/m2.K. As of January 1, 2015, the minimum Rc value was further tightened to 3.5 for floors, 4.5 for facades and 6.0 for roofs. This means that homes built between 2015 and 2018 have seen a significant increase in insulation levels. Solar panels are also sometimes installed during construction. With the introduction of Nearly Energy Neutral Buildings (BENG), it is mandatory to equip new homes with a sustainable energy generation system. Natural gas-free construction became the norm on July 1, 2018.

1900,1964,Single Family House,Semi Detached House,Netherlands,"The wall construction of semi-detached houses in the Netherlands closely follows the same technological and regulatory developments as detached houses.

Over time, changes in materials, prefabrication methods, and energy regulations strongly influenced wall design. 1900–1964: Solid masonry and early post-war systems. Semi-detached houses built before and shortly after the Second World War were predominantly constructed using solid masonry walls and cavity wall systems, typically in brick. This reflects traditional Dutch construction practices, with external walls usually ranging between 20 and 30 cm in thickness. Thermal insulation was generally absent. In the immediate post-war years, increasing housing demand led to the introduction of more industrialized construction methods. Precast concrete elements, steel frame constructions, and standardized building components were increasingly used, particularly in larger housing developments. External walls often consisted of structural concrete or masonry with brick cladding, but insulation levels remained low or nonexistent.","Semi-detached houses built up to and including 1964 represent approximately 4.4% of the Dutch housing stock, comprising 330,000 homes.

1946,1964,Terrace House,Terrace House,Netherlands,"Terracehouses between 1946–1964 often have Cavity Walls with Lightweight Brick, Post-war reconstruction led to the adoption of cavity wall construction. The typical wall consisted of an inner wall leaf of 5 cm solid brick (load-bearing), a 5 cm cavity (unfilled, no insulation), an outer leaf of lightweight brick (approx. 5 cm). This system improved moisture resistance and reduced material use, but still lacked insulation. The Model Bouw Verordening (MBV) of 1965 would later formalise many of these practices.","The terraced houses (between) that were built in the period from 1946 to 1964, represent 235,500 homes, 3.2% of the Dutch housing stock. About half of these are owned by the resident (52%). The other half are rented out (48%). The homes in this category often have 4 to 5 rooms, divided over 3 floors. Due to the housing shortage after the war, the construction industry made a major switch from traditional construction to more industrial construction in this period. The emphasis was on a more efficient construction process in order to be able to realize the large amount of new construction. One aspect of this efficiency improvement is the rise of 'system construction'. It is striking in this construction period that the use of wooden floors is decreasing. Original energy level In the period up to 1965, no requirements were yet set for the energy efficiency of homes. The homes were therefore not insulated. Houses built before 1960 often had steel window frames with single glazing. Many homes were equipped with local gas heaters, electric boilers and natural ventilation at that time. Central heating was used on a limited scale. Current energy level Some of these homes have been improved in terms of energy over the years. Almost all homes now have central heating with individual heat generation. The HR107 combination boiler is the most common (94%). A limited number of homes have a different boiler (CR 1%, VR 1%) or are still heated locally (4%). In addition to combination boilers, gas kitchen geysers (5%) are also used for the preparation of hot tap water. With post-insulation, the emphasis is on installing double glazing (54% of the glass surface) and HR++ glass (23%). A significant number of homes are still equipped with single glazing (16%).  Post-insulation of the closed parts lags far behind. Of the solid facade parts, 38% is insulated, of the floor surface 15%, of the sloping roof 52% and of the flat roof 32%.

1965,1974,Terrace House,Terrace House,Netherlands,"Terracehouses between 1965–1974 introduce multil-layer facades and steel frames. Following the 1965 Model Bouw Verordening (1965 construction permit), terrace houses began incorporating multi-layer facade systems: Load-bearing steel frames (8 cm), Low-level insulation (7 cm, often mineral wool), precast concrete facade plates (8 cm), occasionally, sand-lime brick for the outer layer. This marked experience a shift toward industrialised construction methods, enabling faster building and improved structural performance — though thermal performance remained modest.","The terraced houses (between) that were built in the period from 1965 to 1974, represent 407,000 homes, 5.4% of the Dutch housing stock. Of these, 61% are owned by the resident and 39% are rented out. The homes in this category often have 4 to 5 rooms, divided over 3 floors. A characteristic of this construction period is that system construction is increasingly used. This is particularly visible in the floors, which are made of concrete, and the window frame fillings with sandwich panels. Original energy level Since 1965, requirements have been set for the energy quality of homes. However, the homes were not very well insulated according to current new construction standards. Double glazing was hardly used. Many homes were still equipped with local gas heaters at that time, with central heating on the rise. Current energy level Some of these homes have been improved in terms of energy over the years. All homes have central heating with individual heat generation. The HR107 combination boiler is the most common (95%). A limited number of homes have a different boiler (CR 1%, VR 2%) or are still heated locally (1%).

1975,1991,Terrace House,Terrace House,Netherlands,"Terracehouses between 1975 - 1991 are often constructed as prefabricated Concrete Facades. Wall construction remained largely similar to the 1965–74 period, but the outer facade layer increasingly used prefabricated concrete panels or cast-in-place concrete. Outside layers also use sand lime brick. The inner structure (steel frames, insulation, and load-bearing elements) stayed consistent. This era emphasised durability and standardisation, with energy efficiency still secondary to structural and cost considerations.","The terraced houses (between) that were built in the period from 1975 to 1991, represent 573,000 homes, 7.7% of the Dutch housing stock. Of these, 70% are owned by the resident and 30% are rented out. The homes that fall into this category often have 4 to 5 rooms, divided over 3 floors. A characteristic of this construction period is that system construction continues to develop. This mainly concerns walls and facades that are made of prefabricated concrete or cast construction. New in this period are concrete floors with insulation. System construction continues to develop through the introduction of prefabricated concrete facades and system roofs.  The requirements for the energy quality of new-build homes were increased in 1975 (Rc 1.3 m2K/W for roof and solid facade), in 1979 (double glazing living room), in 1983 (Rc 1.3 m2K/W ground floor) and in 1988 (Rc 2.0 m2K/W for roof and solid facade). The homes from the first part of this period in particular were not very well insulated according to current new-build standards. It was striking in this construction period that the energy requirements of homes in the social rental sector were higher than those of other homes. For example, social housing had to be rental properties in the living areas have been fitted with double glazing since 1975. Nevertheless, double glazing was widely used in all properties. In addition, in many properties, the floor was better insulated than required. Central heating with a VR boiler was widely used. Current energy level All properties have central heating with mainly individual heat generation (93%) and connection to district heating (7%). The HR107 combination boiler is the most common (88%). A small proportion of the properties have a VR boiler (3%) or are connected to district heating (heat supply by third parties 7%). In addition to combination boilers, virtually no other appliances such as electric boilers, gas boilers or kitchen geysers are used to prepare hot tap water. The majority of the homes are equipped with mechanical ventilation (57%). In addition, natural ventilation is mainly used (41%) and limited balanced ventilation (2%). All homes are equipped with draught-proofing. Some of the properties have been fitted with double glazing since they were completed. This part of the glass surface is mainly replaced by HR++ glass in the event of renovations. The share of double glazing is large (64% of the glass surface). A considerable part of the glass surface of these homes is already HR++ glass (21%). The share of single glazing is 8%.  Almost all closed facade parts, floors and roofs are insulated, but in most cases the insulation level is not very high."
1992,2005,Terrace House,Terrace House,Netherlands,"Terracehouses between 1992–2005 have improved Insulation under Bouwbesluit 1992 (the building regulation from 1992). The 1992 Bouwbesluit introduced stricter energy performance requirements. Typical external wall systems included 7 cm load-bearing brick layer (or concrete plates), 7 cm medium insulation (glass wool or mineral fibers) and 7 cm sand-lime brick facade. This era saw a clear move toward better thermal performance, with insulation becoming a significant component in the design process rather than an afterthought. Concrete load-bearing elements became more common, reflecting broader trends in industrialised construction.","The terraced houses (between) that were built in the period from 1992 to 2005, represent 262,000 homes, 3.5% of the Dutch housing stock.

During this period, many terraced houses were built with sand-lime bricks. In addition, cast construction is taking off and there is less interest in prefabricated construction with prefabricated concrete elements. Original energy level The homes from this period are well insulated. In 1992, the insulation requirements were increased, which made double glazing and insulation of the facade, floor and roof (Rc 2.5 m2K/W) commonplace. Central heating with a VR boiler was used to heat the home. Current energy level All homes have central heating with individual heat generation (83%) or a connection to district heating (17%).

Homes in this category often have 4 to 5 rooms, spread over 2 or 3 floors. Compared to previous years, more concrete is being used instead of sand-lime brick. Increased sound insulation requirements play a significant role in this. Original energy level: Homes from this period were well insulated. Between 2006 and 2014, the EPC requirement was tightened from 1.0 to 0.6. As a result, homes were even better insulated during this period. High-efficiency boilers were widely used for heating.

Furthermore, there is a further shift from poured construction to prefabricated construction. Original energy level: As of April 1, 2012, the Building Decree increased the minimum Rc value (thermal resistance) of floors, facades, and roofs of new buildings from 2.5 to 3.5 m².K/W.

As of January 1, 2015, the minimum Rc value has been further tightened to 3.5 for floors, 4.5 for facades and 6.0 for roofs. This means that homes built between 2015 and 2018 have seen a significant improvement in insulation levels. Solar panels are also sometimes installed during construction.

Typically, the load-bearing layer is made out of cast concrete with 10 cm to 15 cm thickness, the insulation layer has a thickness between 5 cm and 8 cm, the facade is still commonly made out of brick, such as sand-lime brick and has a standard measure of 5 cm thickness. ","The 20,500 terraced houses (corner houses) built between 2015 and 2018 represent 0.3% of the Dutch housing stock. Of these, 90% are owned by the residents, and 10% are rented. The houses in this category often have 4 to 5 rooms spread over 3 floors. Due to increasingly stringent sound insulation requirements, more concrete is being used in construction. Furthermore, there is a further shift from poured construction to prefabricated construction. Original energy level: As of April 1, 2012, the Building Decree increased the minimum Rc value (thermal resistance) of floors, facades, and roofs of new buildings from 2.5 to 3.5 m².K/W. Subsequently, on March 1, 2013, the maximum U-value of windows was tightened from 2.2 to 1.65 W/m².K. As of January 1, 2015, the minimum Rc value has been further tightened to 3.5 for floors, 4.5 for facades, and 6.0 for roofs. This means that homes built between 2015 and 2018 have seen a significant increase in insulation levels. Solar panels are also sometimes installed during construction. With the introduction of BENG (Netherlands Energy Efficiency Directive), it is mandatory to equip new homes with a sustainable energy generation system. Natural gas-free construction became the standard as of July 1, 2018. Current energy level: Many homes still have central heating with individual heat generation (42%) and increasingly, connections to district heating (58%). In addition to third-party heat supply (58%) and the HR107 combination boiler (40%), heat pumps are used for space heating and hot water. No other appliances such as electric boilers, gas boilers, or kitchen water heaters are used for hot water production. Almost all homes were fitted with HR++ glass or better upon completion (HR++ 67%, triple glazing 28% of the glass surface). Double glazing is used to a very limited extent (5%). All solid facades, floors, and roofs are insulated, with the insulation level meeting at least the requirements from the construction period. Almost all homes have mechanical ventilation (98%). In addition, balanced ventilation is used to a very limited extent (2%), and natural ventilation is no longer used. All homes are sealed."

Approximately 46% are owned by the resident, and 54% are rented. Homes in this category often have 3 to 4 rooms, spread over 2 or 3 floors. They are accessible via a secure porch or are ground-floor/upper-floor units. Homes in this category are often built traditionally with brick walls and facades. The floors and roof cladding are often wooden. Original energy level: Until 1965, no energy efficiency requirements were imposed on homes. Therefore, homes were not insulated. Until around 1930, no cavity walls were used. Houses built before 1960 often had steel window frames with single glazing. Many houses were equipped with local gas heaters, electric boilers, and natural ventilation at that time. Current energy level: Some of these houses have been improved over the years. All houses now have central heating, with 94% individually generated, 5% collectively, and 1% connected to district heating. The HR107 combination boiler is the most common (83%).

In addition to combination boilers, electric boilers (6%), gas bath and kitchen water heaters (6%) are also used for hot water production. With post-insulation, the focus is on installing double glazing (55% of the glass surface) and very limited use of high-efficiency glass or better (high-efficiency 9%, high-efficiency 2%, and high-efficiency 14%). One-fifth of the glass surface is single-glazed (20%). Post-insulation of solid sections lags far behind.

1900,1964,Apartment House,Apartment Block,Netherlands,"The wall construction of apartment buildings in the Netherlands has historically differed from that of single-family housing due to scale, structural demands, and the need for rapid housing production. Especially after the Second World War, apartment construction became strongly associated with industrialized, prefabricated concrete systems. Over time, energy regulations gradually improved thermal performance, but changes occurred more slowly than in detached and semi-detached housing. 1900–1964: Early masonry and post-war industrial construction. Apartment buildings constructed between 1900 and 1964 reflect a major transition in Dutch construction practices. While early apartment buildings were still partially built using traditional masonry, the severe post-war housing shortage led to a rapid shift toward industrialized construction methods. Efficiency, speed, and standardization became central priorities. From the post-war period onward, apartment buildings were increasingly constructed using prefabricated concrete panels, often combined with steel structural elements. Façades were typically made of plain exposed concrete, concrete panels with minimal finishing, or lightweight façade systems incorporating aluminium profiles. Wall thicknesses were generally very slim, commonly ranging between 8 and 15 cm for load-bearing concrete elements. Until 1965, no energy efficiency requirements were imposed on residential buildings. As a result, apartment buildings from this period generally contain no thermal insulation. Cavity walls were uncommon before approximately 1930 and were rarely applied in apartment construction during this era.","The remaining apartment buildings built up to and including 1964 represent approximately 0.6% of the Dutch housing stock, totaling 44,000. The majority (80%) are rented, while the remaining 20% are owner-occupied. These apartments often have two to four rooms. Single-story apartments are part of a multi-story building. They are accessible via a central hall or corridor. Due to the post-war housing shortage, the construction industry made a major shift from traditional to more industrial construction during this period. The emphasis was on a more efficient construction process to accommodate the large number of new construction projects. One aspect of this efficiency improvement was the rise of prefabricated construction after the war. Original energy level: Until 1965, no energy efficiency requirements were imposed on homes. Therefore, homes were not insulated. Cavity walls were not used until around 1930. At that time, apartment buildings were primarily heated by local gas heaters. For hot water, the apartments were equipped with electric boilers and, in some cases, kitchen water heaters. Current energy level: Some of these homes have seen some energy improvements over the years. All homes have central heating. Individual heating is the most common (73%). The remaining homes have collective heating (23%) or limited heat supply from third parties (3%). For individual heating, the HR107 boiler is most common (58%). Some homes have a different boiler (CR 10%, VR 4%), or a heat pump (1%). In addition to combination boilers (62%) and collective systems (13%), electric boilers (23%) and heat pumps (1%) are also used for hot water production. When it comes to retrofitting insulation, the focus is on installing double glazing (49% of the glass surface) and HR++ glass (20%). A significant portion of the glass surface is still single glazing (29%). Retrofitting insulation of the solid sections lags far behind. Of the solid facade sections, 32% are insulated, 6% of the floor, 1% of the pitched roof, and 35% of the flat roof. Most homes have natural ventilation (73%). 19% have mechanical ventilation, and 8% have balanced ventilation. Some homes are fitted with airtight sealing."
1965,1974,Apartment House,Apartment Block,Netherlands,"The wall construction of apartment buildings in the Netherlands has historically differed from that of single-family housing due to scale, structural demands, and the need for rapid housing production. Especially after the Second World War, apartment construction became strongly associated with industrialized, prefabricated concrete systems. Over time, energy regulations gradually improved thermal performance, but changes occurred more slowly than in detached and semi-detached housing. 1965–1974: Standardized prefab systems with minimal insulation (MBV 1965). During this period, apartment construction continued to rely heavily on prefabricated concrete and steel-frame systems, following the Model Bouwverordening (MBV) 1965. Although this regulation introduced basic performance requirements, thermal insulation remained limited. External walls typically consisted of thin, load-bearing concrete panels (approximately 8–15 cm), combined with façade panels made of concrete, stone, or occasionally plastic (PVC-based) cladding. In many apartment buildings, insulation was either minimal or entirely absent, particularly in lower-cost housing developments. Thermal performance therefore remained low.","The remaining apartment buildings built between 1965 and 1974 represent 33,000 units, representing 0.4% of the Dutch housing stock. Almost all units (90%) are rented, and only 10% are owner-occupied. The units in this category often have 2 to 4 rooms. Single-story units are part of a multi-story building. They are accessible via a central hall or corridor. A characteristic of this construction period is the introduction and increasing use of prefabricated construction. Original Energy Level: Since 1965, requirements have been imposed on the energy quality of homes. However, by current new construction standards, the homes were not very well insulated. Many apartment buildings during this construction period were equipped with local gas heaters and electric boilers or district heating. The homes were often naturally ventilated. Current energy level: A number of these homes have been energy-efficiently upgraded over the years. Collective heating is the most common type (67%). Individual heating (20%) and heat supplied by third parties (13%) are less common.
Individual central heating is relatively rare; VR boilers (14%) and HR107 boilers (6%) are used here. Hot water is provided in 40% of homes by the collective heating system and in 11% by third-party heat supply. Furthermore, 23% of homes are heated by an electric boiler, 20% by a combination boiler (VR and HR107), and 6% by a kitchen water heater. Regarding retrofitting, the focus is on installing double glazing (79% of the glass surface) and partially HR++ glazing (14%). Single glazing still accounts for 6% of the homes. Retrofitting insulation of the solid sections lags far behind. Of the solid facades, 44% are insulated, and of the roofs, 35% are insulated. Most of the homes have mechanical ventilation (84%). The remainder are naturally ventilated (16%). Some of the homes are sealed with airtight seals."
1975,1991,Apartment House,Apartment Block,Netherlands,"The wall construction of apartment buildings in the Netherlands has historically differed from that of single-family housing due to scale, structural demands, and the need for rapid housing production. Especially after the Second World War, apartment construction became strongly associated with industrialized, prefabricated concrete systems. Over time, energy regulations gradually improved thermal performance, but changes occurred more slowly than in detached and semi-detached housing. 1974–1991: Incremental improvements, but limited insulation. Between 1974 and 1991, energy awareness increased, but apartment buildings still showed relatively modest improvements compared to single-family housing. Construction methods remained largely similar to the previous period, with extensive use of prefabricated or partially on-site cast concrete elements. Load-bearing wall thicknesses typically remained between 8 and 15 cm. Insulation was sometimes applied, but often in limited thicknesses or only in specific building components. Many apartment buildings from this era therefore still exhibit low to moderate thermal performance.","The remaining apartment buildings built between 1975 and 1991 represent 98,000 units, representing 1.3% of the Dutch housing stock. More than two-thirds (70%) are rented, while the remaining 30% are owner-occupied. These homes often have two to three rooms. Single-story homes are part of a multi-story building. They are accessible via a central hall or corridor. Prefabricated construction was frequently used during this period. Cast-in construction, and to a lesser extent, sand-lime brick, was also used. This is due to stricter noise regulations. Original energy level: The energy requirements for new-build homes were increased in 1975 (Rc 1.3 m²K/W for roof and solid facade), in 1979 (double glazing in living areas), in 1983 (Rc 1.3 m²K/W ground floor), and in 1988 (Rc 2.0 m²K/W for roof and solid facade). Houses from the first part of this period, in particular, were not very well insulated by current new-build standards. It was striking during this construction period that the energy requirements for social housing were higher than those of other housing. For example, social housing units were required to have double glazing in the living areas as early as 1975. Nevertheless, double glazing was widely used in all homes. Many apartment buildings during this construction period were equipped with local gas heaters, electric boilers, and natural ventilation. Central heating was increasingly used. Current energy level: All homes have central heating. Individual heating is the most common (57%), along with collective heating (32%) and third-party heat supply (11%). For individual heating, the HR107 combination boiler is most common (41%). The VR combination boiler is also used (10%). Local gas heating is no longer common, but local electric heating is used (5%). In addition to combination boilers (52%, both VR and HR), collective systems (19%), and third-party heat supply (10%), electric boilers (15%) and continuous flow water heaters (4%) are used for hot water production. Some homes have been fitted with double glazing since completion. Double glazing accounts for a large portion (79% of the glass surface). A small portion of the glass surface in these homes is still single-glazed (7% of the glass surface). HR++ glass accounts for 13%. Nearly all solid facade sections are insulated, although the insulation level is generally not very high (see above). Most homes have mechanical ventilation (85%). Natural ventilation is also available (15%). All homes are sealed with airtight seals."
1992,2005,Apartment House,Apartment Block,Netherlands,"The wall construction of apartment buildings in the Netherlands has historically differed from that of single-family housing due to scale, structural demands, and the need for rapid housing production. Especially after the Second World War, apartment construction became strongly associated with industrialized, prefabricated concrete systems. Over time, energy regulations gradually improved thermal performance, but changes occurred more slowly than in detached and semi-detached housing. 1992–2005: Introduction of insulation under Bouwbesluit 1992. The introduction of the Bouwbesluit 1992 marked a turning point for apartment construction in terms of energy performance. From this period onward, insulation became a standard component of external wall assemblies.
Apartment buildings were commonly constructed using prefabricated concrete panels or partially on-site cast concrete structures. Load-bearing concrete walls typically increased in thickness to approximately 15–25 cm. Insulation materials such as EPS were commonly used in façade systems, while XPS was often applied in lower regions of the building due to its higher moisture resistance. Overall, insulation levels improved to a medium standard compared to earlier periods.","The remaining apartment buildings built between 1992 and 2005 represent 128,000 units, representing approximately 1.7% of the Dutch housing stock. Nearly half of these homes are rented (48%). The remaining half are owner-occupied (52%). Homes in this category often have three rooms. These single-story homes are part of a multi-story building. They are accessible via a central hall or corridor. A characteristic of this construction period is that few apartments were built traditionally. Prefabricated construction was the most common construction method. Original energy level: The homes from this period were well insulated. In 1992, insulation requirements were raised, making double glazing and insulation of the facade, floor, and roof (Rc 2.5 m²K/W) commonplace. The homes were often equipped with (individual) central heating with a VR boiler and mechanical ventilation. Current energy level: All homes have central heating. Individual heating is the most common (88%), along with heat supplied by third parties (11%) and, to a very limited extent, collective heating (1%). For individual heating, the HR107 combination boiler is most common (86%), and a small proportion of homes have a VR boiler (2%). Hot water is primarily heated by individual combination boilers (88%) and, to a very limited extent, by kitchen water heaters (1%).
All homes were fitted with double glazing (44% of the glass surface) or HR++ glass (43%) upon completion. Single glazing is still used to a very limited extent (1%). The remaining glass surface is HR (6%) or HR+ (6%). All solid facades, floors, and roofs are insulated, with the insulation level meeting at least the requirements from the construction period (Rc 2.5 m²K/W). Most homes are equipped with mechanical ventilation (88%). In addition, balanced ventilation is becoming increasingly popular (11%), and limited mechanical ventilation with heat recovery and control is used (1%). Fully natural ventilation is no longer used. All homes are equipped with airtight seals."
2006,2014,Apartment House,Apartment Block,Netherlands,"The wall construction of apartment buildings in the Netherlands has historically differed from that of single-family housing due to scale, structural demands, and the need for rapid housing production. Especially after the Second World War, apartment construction became strongly associated with industrialized, prefabricated concrete systems. Over time, energy regulations gradually improved thermal performance, but changes occurred more slowly than in detached and semi-detached housing. 2006–2014: Higher insulation requirements (Bouwbesluit 2012 revised). During this period, apartment construction continued to rely on concrete-based structural systems, in line with revised energy performance requirements under the Bouwbesluit 2012. External walls typically consisted of 15–25 cm thick load-bearing concrete elements combined with increased insulation thickness and improved thermal detailing. While construction typologies remained similar to those of the previous period, insulation values and airtightness were further improved.","The remaining apartment buildings built between 2006 and 2014 represent 109,500 units, representing approximately 1.5% of the Dutch housing stock. More than half of the units are rented (71%), while the remaining 29% are owner-occupied.
The units in this category often have three rooms. The single-story units are part of a multi-story building. They are accessible via a central hall or corridor. A characteristic of this construction period is that few apartment buildings were built traditionally. Cast-in and prefabricated concrete construction was the most common construction method. Original energy level: The homes from this period were well insulated. Between 2006 and 2014, the EPC requirement was tightened from 1.0 to 0.6. As a result, homes from this period were even better insulated. High-efficiency boilers were widely used for heating the homes. Balanced ventilation was also emphasized. Current energy level: All homes have central heating. Individual heating is the most common (45%), followed by collective heating (32%) and heat supplied by third parties (23%). For individual heating, the HR107 combination boiler is the most common (42%). A small proportion of homes have a heat pump (3%). The same distribution applies to hot water heating using individual combination boilers (42%), heat pumps (3%), or collective heating systems (32%), and heat supplied by third parties (23%). All homes were fitted with high-efficiency glass (19% of the glass surface) or HR++ glass (75%) upon completion. Single glazing (2%) and double glazing (2%) are still used to a very limited extent.

2015,2018,Apartment House,Apartment Block,Netherlands,"The wall construction of apartment buildings in the Netherlands has historically differed from that of single-family housing due to scale, structural demands, and the need for rapid housing production. Especially after the Second World War, apartment construction became strongly associated with industrialized, prefabricated concrete systems. Over time, energy regulations gradually improved thermal performance, but changes occurred more slowly than in detached and semi-detached housing. 2015–2018: Optimized concrete wall systems. Apartment buildings constructed between 2015 and 2018 show no fundamental change in wall construction type compared to the preceding period. Concrete remains the dominant load-bearing material, with wall thicknesses generally between 15 and 25 cm. However, insulation performance improved further through the use of higher-quality materials and better integration of insulation layers. These buildings typically exhibit medium to good thermal performance, reflecting stricter energy efficiency standards and improved construction practices.","The remaining apartment buildings built between 2015 and 2018 represent approximately 0.3% of the Dutch housing stock, totaling 18,500. Most of these properties are rented (72%), with the remaining 28% being owner-occupied.
These properties often have three rooms. Single-story apartments are part of a multi-story building. They are accessible via a central hall or corridor. A characteristic of this construction period is that few apartments were built traditionally. Cast-in and prefabricated concrete construction was the most common construction method. Original energy level: As of April 1, 2012, the Building Decree increased the minimum Rc value (thermal resistance) of floors, facades, and roofs of new buildings from 2.5 to 3.5 m².K/W. Subsequently, on March 1, 2013, the maximum U-value of windows was tightened from 2.2 to 1.65 W/m².K. As of January 1, 2015, the minimum Rc value was further tightened to 3.5 for floors, 4.5 for facades, and 6.0 for roofs. This means that homes built between 2015 and 2018 will see a significant increase in insulation level. Solar panels are also sometimes installed during construction. With the introduction of BENG (Netherlands Energy Efficiency Directive), it is mandatory to equip new homes with a sustainable energy generation system. As of July 1, 2018, natural gas-free construction is the standard. Current energy level: All homes have central heating. Collective heating is the most common (62%), followed by individual heating (38%). For individual heating, only the HR107 combination boiler is used (38%). Domestic hot water is also heated exclusively by these HR107 combination boilers (38%). Almost all homes were fitted with HR++ glass upon completion (96% of the glass surface). HR glass was used to a very limited extent (3%). Single and double glazing are no longer present.
All solid facades, floors, and roofs are insulated, with the insulation level meeting at least the requirements from the construction period. Almost all homes are equipped with mechanical ventilation (63%) or mechanical ventilation with heat recovery and CO2 control (36%). Balanced ventilation is also used to a limited extent (1%). All homes are fitted with airtight seals."
